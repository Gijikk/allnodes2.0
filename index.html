            <p>A node is a component of cryptocurrency required for most popular currencies such as Bitcoin and
                Dogecoin, to function. In addition, it’s an essential component of the blockchain network, a
                decentralized ledger used to keep track of cryptocurrencies.</p></div>

            <h1>SOME THEORY</h1>
            <div class="text">
                <p>A cryptocurrency node is any active wallet in a given ecosystem. The word node has a Latin meaning
                    and is
                    translated as knot. That is, the equipment of each holder of digital coins is a network node. The
                    exception is
                    holders who use a paper wallet or a hardware safe, but only as long as they do not want to present
                    capital in
                    motion. Web wallets that work through connect to a remote network node and act only through data
                    filters. Each
                    miner is also a node, but not every network node is a miner.
                </p>
                <p>The base nodes are each child. There are distributed registries without miners, but no peer-to-peer
                    network will
                    come out without full nodes. After all, it is they who store full copies of the ledger and,
                    synchronizing with
                    each other, update the data to the current version. Usually a node is a real piece of computing
                    equipment, that
                    is, a personal computer connected to the Internet with a local wallet installed, which is
                    synchronized with the
                    search. What is with others includes the same networks and each copy of the distributed ledger in
                    their absolute
                    identity. But in principle, the node can be stable. Symptoms and relief of network nodes, no signs
                    of symptoms
                    appearing, as well as special nodes of other types. They all need to be connected to the same
                    peer-to-peer
                    network in order to exchange information.</p>

The owner of a full node does not receive dividends, but if you have invested in this cryptocurrency and you have the opportunity to run and maintain a node of this type, it is highly recommended to do so. A full node enforces the rules and protects the blockchain from hackers and scammers. In addition, full node is a reliable wallet for storing crypto assets.</p></span></span>

Miners participate in transaction processing and block formation, but have the right to write a new block to the blockchain without the approval of other full nodes.
